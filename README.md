# Trackers
This repository (aptly named) is where I'm going to be storing all of my trackers moving forward.

Each project will be its own folder inside of the `src` folder.


## Requirements
The following is required to run this locally:
* Node v14.17.0 (newer may work, this is my version)
    * install using nvm for either [linux](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) 
* Yarn 
    * Once node is installed (and available on your PATH) you can run the following in the project folder (i.e. `src/objective-tracker`):
    * `yarn install`
    * `yarn start`
